  # The app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID — that's $99/yr we don't pay).
  # macOS Gatekeeper still applies a quarantine attribute when Homebrew downloads
  # the .dmg, and on Apple Silicon it refuses to launch arm64 binaries that
  # don't have a fresh signature. Strip quarantine + re-apply ad-hoc signature
  # automatically here so the user never has to open Terminal.
